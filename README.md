# EB-LBA

I implemented the Exemplar-based Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (EB-LBA), which integrates the exemplar-based representations (EB) and linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) models. 

This model assumes that the test item activates the stored representations of exemplars, which start a race for retrieval. The retrieved exemplar drives an accumulation of evidence, which will be mapped onto the LBA mechanisms. How exemplars are represented and how the stored exemplars are compared with test items to drive evidence accumulation depends on the tasks' nature.
